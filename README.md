# Sheepy: A Short Adventure - Unofficial Web Port

This is a port of the game [Sheepy: A Short Adventure](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1568400/Sheepy_A_Short_Adventure/) to the web. Since the original game uses the [Construct](https://www.construct.net/en) game engine with no native code, only minimal changes are needed to get it to run on web browsers.

## Features:
- Local achievements
- Reduced memory usage (3GB -> 300MB on the title screen)
- Runs in Firefox/Chrome on any OS
- Controller support

## Building:
To build this port for yourself, run `./build.sh`. You must be on Linux with `pcregrep`, `curl`, `jq`, and NodeJS installed.

## License:
The copyright for the original game belongs to MrSuicideSheep, but the patches for this port are under the MIT license.

This repository does not contain any of the game's code, only the modifications needed to build this port are included.
