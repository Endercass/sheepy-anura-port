# Sheepy: A Short Adventure - Unofficial Web Port

This is a port of the game [Sheepy: A Short Adventure](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1568400/Sheepy_A_Short_Adventure/) to the web. Since the original game uses the [Construct](https://www.construct.net/en) game engine with no native code, only minimal changes are needed to get it to run on web browsers.

## Building:
To build this port for yourself, run `./build.sh`. You must be on Linux with `pcregrep`, `curl`, `jq`, and NodeJS installed.

## License:
The copyright for the original game belongs to MrSuicideSheep, but the patches for this port are under the MIT license.
